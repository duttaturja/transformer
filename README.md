## Introduction

This project provides an in-depth implementation of the Transformer architecture, a model introduced in the paper "[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer has become foundational in various NLP applications due to its efficiency and scalability.

## Features

- End-to-end implementation of the Transformer model.
- Customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.
- Training and evaluation scripts for NLP tasks.
- Visualization tools for attention mechanisms.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duttaturja/transformer.git
   cd transformer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start training the Transformer model using the provided Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook transformer.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the model.**

## Examples

The `transformer.ipynb` notebook includes detailed examples demonstrating:

- Data preprocessing steps.
- Model training procedures.
- Evaluation metrics and interpretation.
- Visualization of attention weights.
